# Task:


Java Task  :
 
Create a simple Spring Boot application that exposes a rest API with one method
Create Data
Input:
{
id: <number>,
name: <String>
}
The method should create a record in the database if the id doesnâ€™t exists, otherwise return a bad request with a message and return no content
 
No one can use this method unless he have a valid JWT token generated by authenticate user method
The authenticate user input
{
               Username: <string>,
Password: <String>
}
Return a JWT that will expire in 30 min with username claim

 
# Solution

First, we will start to create the entity for each of the Data and User

Then, we will create the Repository, Service and Controller for each of them.

The task says that we need only a create method for the Data

No one can use the method unless he have a valid JWT token, so we need to set some security configurations
 ![image](https://github.com/islam-365/Coderz/assets/85651011/aad49456-1f26-4b26-9540-35d8fdb47861)


In the SecurityConstants file, we will set up the time for the token to expire after 30 min

I will be using the H2 database for the purpose of demonstration.

Test the application: 

Now to test the application, we will run some request with Postman.
First, we will run the Application

Requests:

1- Create User
We can see in the first pic that the request is successful and it give us a 201 created code

We can also see that the user data is uploaded to the database

2- Authenticate User

By authenticate user, we can get the token so we can use it to create the Data we need

3- Creating Data

Using the token we got from the authentication, now we can create Data wit it.
First we will set up the token

And now we can make some requests
 ![image](https://github.com/islam-365/Coderz/assets/85651011/e04ca1e4-fa1a-4a57-8c98-2ef7447aecd6)






And we can check the data from the database
